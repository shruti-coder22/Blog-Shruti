                    the Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Sydney's two most famous landmarks, the other being the Opera House.

                    <br>

                    Completed in 1932, the construction of the bridge - known locally as "The coathanger" - was an economic feat as well as an engineering triumph. Prior to the bridge being built, the only links between the city centre in the south and the residential north were by ferry or by a 20 kilometre (12½ mile) road route that involved five bridge crossings.


                    <br>
                    The Sydney Harbour Bridge, which is known locally as the "Coat Hanger", took eight years to build, including the railway line. The bridge was manufactured in sections on a site that is now occupied by Luna Park fun fair.

                    In 1825 the NSW Government began work on an inland road to connect Sydney to the Hunter Valley, a distance of 264 kilometres. Up to 720 convicts worked on the Great North Road and built stonework including buttresses, culverts, bridges and 9-metre-high retaining walls. The road was completed in 1836.
                    <br>
                    The Great North Road was not popular. It was isolated, had no permanent watercourses, and bypassed existing settlements. Coastal steamers became the preferred means of travel to the Hunter Valley, and by the time the road was completed in 1836 it was almost redundant.
                    <br>
                    The Old Great North Road is a 43-kilometre section that runs from Wisemans Ferry in the south to Mount Manning (near Bucketty) in the north. It runs within and adjacent to Dharug National Park and passes in and out of Yengo National Park.
                    <br>
                    It is called the Old Great North Road because it is the most intact section of the original road that remains undeveloped. The World Heritage-listed section of the Old Great North Road is about 7 kilometres long and lies within Dharug National Park. The road is closed to motor vehicles but can be walked.

                <p>In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
